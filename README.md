# [Project 1: Titanic survival classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/dejunhuang/getting-started-with-titanic)
* Step through the use of Kaggle kernals and result subimission
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset
* Use basic (fixed value) and advanced methods (calculated values from different slices of data) for fillna
* Compared some of the most widly used classifiers in practice (Randomforest, gradientboosting, xgboost)
* Use early stop & slow learning rate strategy to get close to the global minima
